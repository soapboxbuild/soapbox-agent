# Audette modeling recipes

Practical mechanics for working with the Audette platform during decarb-plan engagements.
Verified live against the Audette API/tools on 2026-07-03/04. Read this before P1.5
building-model fixes, P3 measure/share configuration, or any large Audette batch.

## 1. Building GFA is NOT editable in place

`edit_building_attributes` has no GFA key — you cannot fix a wrong gross floor area on an
existing building record. If the building geometry is wrong (see P1.5 validation), the fix is
a rebuild, not an edit:

1. `create_building` with the **correct** `gross_floor_area_square_feet` computed from the real
   footprint × stories (per the ALTA/PCA reconciliation in P1.5).
2. `assign_property_to_building` to the **existing** `property_uid`. Never call
   `create_property_for_building` when the property already exists — that creates a duplicate
   property record instead of attaching the corrected building to the real one.
3. `delete_building_model` on the old, wrong building set. This requires the `DELETE_BUILDING`
   permission — verified available on the platform account as of 2026-07.
4. Re-upload utility data and re-apply landlord/tenant shares and exit assumptions to the new
   buildings. **Nothing carries over** from the deleted buildings — treat the rebuild as a clean
   slate for every downstream setting.

## 2. Landlord/tenant share fields

Two independent levels, easy to confuse:

- **Building level** — `edit_building_attributes` updates:
  - `default_landlord_share_electricity`
  - `default_landlord_share_natural_gas`
  - `default_landlord_share_steam`
  - `default_landlord_share_cost`
  All are 0–1 floats.
- **Measure level** — `landlord_share_*` fields (no `default_` prefix) on each measure inside
  `create_custom_plan` / `update_custom_plan_measures`. These override the building default for
  that specific measure. Also set `like_for_like_cost` per measure — this is the incremental-cost
  basis the IRR is computed against.

**Common agent error**: trying `landlord_share_*` (missing `default_` prefix) at the *building*
level throws an `AttributeError`, which gets misread as "shares are account-level only, not
per-building." That conclusion is wrong — shares are configurable at both building and measure
level, just with different field names. Use `default_landlord_share_*` for buildings and
`landlord_share_*` for measures.

## 3. Exit assumptions per building

Set via `edit_building_attributes`:
- `assumed_exit_cap_rate`
- `assumed_exit_year`
- `assumed_gross_asset_value`

**Important**: Audette's measure-level IRR output does **not** include residual/exit value or
BPS fine avoidance, even when these exit fields are populated — they inform other Audette
outputs but are not folded into the measure IRR. Per the IRR doctrine, any exit value or fine
avoidance used in a report must be layered on manually, with every IRR stating its bases
explicitly (energy savings only, vs. + exit value, vs. + fine avoidance).

## 4. Batch size / token fragility

Large parallel Audette tool-call bursts (~27+ simultaneous calls in one turn) have repeatedly
killed the OAuth token mid-batch. Until refresh-persistence is fixed platform-side:

- Batch **≤8–10 Audette calls per turn**.
- Checkpoint progress in `state` after every batch — record which buildings/measures are done
  vs. pending, not just an aggregate count.
- Expect to need a reconnect and resume mid-engagement on large portfolios; design the workflow
  so resuming from the checkpoint is mechanical, not a re-derivation.

## 5. Equipment survey proxy for in-unit gas systems

Garden-style buildings with in-unit gas water heaters that serve **both** DHW and space heating
(via fan coils) don't have a literal equipment match in some modeling tools. Model as:

`central_plant_heater = gas_boiler + fan_coil_units`

This is not a physically accurate description of the actual in-unit equipment, but it produces
the correct fuel assignment (`NATURAL_GAS`) and distribution type, which matters far more for
downstream carbon/BPS results than literal equipment fidelity. The tool's own default — absent
this proxy — wrongly assumes electric heating, which misstates fuel mix and compliance exposure.
Always document the proxy explicitly in `state` so it isn't mistaken for a data error on review.

## 6. Utility allocation recipe (never-even-split rule)

1. Carve out audit-identified common/amenity loads first (typical magnitude: ~4% of electricity,
   ~2–3% of gas for garden-style multifamily — confirm against the specific audit, don't assume).
2. Allocate the remainder **GFA-weighted** across residential buildings — never an even split
   per building.
3. Within each building, apply the property's real monthly seasonal profile (not a flat
   12-way split) scaled to that building's annual share.
4. Unconditioned utility/mechanical buildings get **no** utility data assigned.
5. Verify: sum of all building-level allocations must reconcile to the source (ESPM/utility
   bill) total with zero variance. Any nonzero delta means the allocation math is wrong, not
   that there's an acceptable rounding gap.

## 7. Soapbox asset link after a building rebuild

After any rebuild (recipe 1), `assets.metadata.audette_building_uids` on the Soapbox side must
be repointed to the new UID set. This is a platform-side update. Generate the new UID list
programmatically from the freshly created buildings' API responses — never hand-transcribe
UUIDs from logs or chat output; a single transposed character silently breaks the asset-to-model
link with no error at write time.
